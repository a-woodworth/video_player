# Interactive Video Player

Build an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. Use the supplied mockups, video files, and transcript to build an interactive video player that synchronizes the video and the transcript. The transcript should be placed below the video, and should highlight as the video progresses. When a user clicks any part of the transcript it should take them to the appropriate place in the video.
